The proposed system predicts the crop production for the given region.
## Dataset info
The dataset used for this project is available [here](https://data.gov.in/resource/district-wise-season-wise-crop-production-statistics-1997)


The data refers to district wise, crop wise, season wise and year wise data on crop covered area (Hectare) and production (Tonnes). The data is being used to study and analyse crop production, production contribution to district/State/country, Agro-climatic zone wise performance, and high yield production order for crops, crop growing pattern...


### Steps
* Data Preprocessing
* Data Visualization
* Data Grouping
* Using machine learning models to predict the values
  - Random Forest Regression
